# Debug Rules
- Always check terminal output after making changes to backend/main.py
- Always check browser console after making changes to frontend/index.html  
- When fixing bugs, add print() / console.log() FIRST, then fix
- Never remove existing print() statements during this hackathon
- After every fix, test by opening http://localhost:8000 in browser preview
